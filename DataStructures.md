##Array

Structured like so: [1,2,3,4,7,2...] with the nth element called as:
```
<array name>[n-1]
```

##Proof By Induction

Base case- `C[0]`
Inductive step- `C[i] => C[i+1]`
In Sections 6.5 in PDF notes

1. Initialization ← takes in assumptions
2. Loop start
3. Repeated process ← presumes truth
4. Loop end ← truth of invariant + end condition



##Standard algorithm:
*.. What does it do? : Specification
*.. Does it really do what it's supposed to do? : Verification
*.. How efficiently does it do it? : Performance analysis
